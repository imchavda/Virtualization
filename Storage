I have provided you 5GB but you may used only 2GB and other 3GB will be free. 
In Thick Provisioning we can’t do this, because it will allocate the whole space at first itself.

In thin Provisioning if I’m defining 5GB for you it won’t allocate the whole disk space while defining a volume, 
it will grow till 5GB according to your data write,
