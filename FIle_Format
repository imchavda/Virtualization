 File system of ESXi - 
 VMFS - Virtual machine File system use in ESXi and vSphere.

.nvram - This file contain BIOS
.vmx -   This file contains all the configuration information and hardware settings of the VM. RAM size, 
         network interface card info, hard drive info and serial/parallel port info -- advanced power and resource settings, 
         VMware tools options and power management options.
.vmdk -  Virtual disk file which stores the contents of the virtual machine's hard disk drive. 
.vmsd -  This is a centralized file for storing information and metadata about snapshots. 
.vmsn -  Snapshot file extension. 
.vswp - Virtual machine executable (VMX) swap files allow the host to greatly reduce the amount of overhead memory reserved for the VMX process.
ESXi reserves memory per virtual machine for a variety of purposes. Memory for the needs of certain components, 
such as the virtual machine monitor (VMM) and virtual devices, is fully reserved when a virtual machine is powered on. 
However, some of the overhead memory that is reserved for the VMX process can be swapped. 
The VMX swap feature reduces the VMX memory reservation significantly (for example, from about 50MB or more per virtual machine to about 10MB per virtual machine). 
This allows the remaining memory to be swapped out when host memory is overcommitted, reducing overhead memory reservation for each virtual machine.

The host creates VMX swap files automatically, provided there is sufficient free disk space at the time a virtual machine is powered on.
